## 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor


### Project Overview

This project is the first challenge of my coding bootcamp. The objective of this challenge is to refactor the HTML and CSS code of a marketing agency's webpage to improve web accessibility for people with disabilities.

### What was Refactored to Meet Objective?


* Div tags were replaced with semantic HTML elements which allowed for the removal of some classes such as the header and footer class.

* Line spacing and line height was adjusted for all p text elements to make reading easier.

* Comments were added to the CSS to provide reference to what was being styled in the HTML.

* The number of lines of CSS code was reduced by consolidating repeated blocks of code into more general selectors.

* More contrast was given to the 'seo' in the Horiseon h1 header to accomodate color blindness. 

* All images were given an Alt attribute to facilitate screen readers.

* Heading attributes rearanged to fall in sequential order.

* Title element was given a concise, descriptive title.
