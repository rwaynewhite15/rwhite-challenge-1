## 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

### Project Overview

This project is the first challenge of my coding bootcamp. The objective of this challenge is to refactor the HTML and CSS code of a marketing agency's webpage to improve web accessibility for people with disabilities.

### What was Refactored to meet Objective?

* Div tags were replaced with semantic HTML elements which allowed for the removal of some classes such as the header and footer class.

* Line spacing and line height was adjusted for all p text elements to make reading easier.

* Comments were added to the CSS to provide referenct to what was being styled in the HTML.

* The number of lines CSS code was reduced by consolidating repeated blocks of code into more general selectors.

* All images were given an Alt attributes to facilitate screen readers.

* Heading attributes rearanged to fall in sequential order.

* Title element was given a concise, descriptive title.










# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Review
